# Human-Resources-Analytics based on Random Forest

### Introduction 
This repo is my EE-551-Spring individual project. | Name: Bowen Li

### Proposals
In this project, I will use the relevant data set on Kaggle website to establish a Random Forest model to find out the key factors that affact the turnover of employers in an enterprise. Combining these variables into a single indicator will help the company to understand which employees need to be focused on and forecast the employees on the job, and judge the probability of their leaving.
