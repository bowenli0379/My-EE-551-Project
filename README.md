# Human-Resources-Analytics
This repo is my EE-551-Spring individual project. | Name: Bowen Li

# Introduction 
In this project, I will use the relevant data set on Kaggle website to establish a RandomForrest model to find out the key factors that affact the turnover of outstanding employers in an enterprise. Combining these variables into a single indicator will help the company to understand which outstanding employees need to be focused on and forecast the outstanding employees on the job, and judge the probability of their leaving.

# Tools
